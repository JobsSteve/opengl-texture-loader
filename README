PNG Texture Loader for OpenGL (iPhone)

This texture loader allows you to make textures from optimized / non-optimized PNG image files.


<< How to use? >>

1. Add SZGLTextureLoader.* to your project.
2. Now you can use SZGLLoadTexture() function to create OpenGL textures by specifying imagePath and pointers to contain image sizes and texture sizes.

SZGLTexture class is just prepared to show an example to use the SZGLLoadTexture() function, but I suppose it has enough implementation to make games. SZGLTexture class allows you to rotate, scale and change alpha value to render.


<< About PNG optiomizataion for iPhone >>

When we build an iPhone application for real devices, iPhone SDK automatically optimize all PNG images by pngcrush tool. Then those PNG files have different byte-ordering (RGBA to BGRA), and alpha values are multiplied to RGB values for each pixels.

This PNG loader pre-divides RGB values by alpha values to cancel the premultiplication. It is not perfect, because we cannot get 0xff red value from 0x00 red value, nor get any original value from 0x00 alpha value. But I bet that the canceling is enough for human eyes in most cases.

It is also a good idea to use "IPHONE_OPTIMIZE_OPTIONS=-skip-PNGs" option in your Xcode project settings. It will completely disable the optimization problem.

Note that the image file sizes will be changed so drastically by the iPhone optimization. In most of the cases in my test, image file sizes were increased from original files. I also bet that the optimization won't affect your game speed so much.

But iPhone SDK performs the optimization actually. It should exist for some reasons. I think the main reason we can guess at now is the byte-ordering (BGRA instead of RGBA). So I recommend to leave the iPhone optimization for PNG files enabled, if you are satisfied by the rendered result.
