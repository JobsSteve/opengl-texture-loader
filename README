Sazameki OpenGL Texture Loader for iPhone

This texture loader allows you to make textures from any kind of images including optimized / non-optimized PNG image files and PVRTC files. RGB values affected by alpha values will be corrected.


<< How to use? >>

1. Add SZGLTextureLoader.* to your project.
2. Now you can use SZGLLoadTexture() function to create OpenGL textures by specifying imagePath and pointers to contain image sizes and texture sizes.

SZGLTexture class is just prepared to show an example to use the SZGLLoadTexture() function, but I suppose it has enough implementation to make games. SZGLTexture class allows you to rotate, scale and change alpha value to render.
